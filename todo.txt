unimplemented
  - prop motion
  - turntables: `kat_apply_turntable_contact`
  - water: `kat_update_water_contact`
  - dynamic prop alphas
  - a billion other things

features
  savestates
    - `Serialize` interface for save/loading savestates, implemented on all
      relevant game state structs
  resetting
    - `Reset` interface to reset attempt-specific bits of game state
      - implement it on all parts of `GameState`
      - `derive` it on structs for which all fields are `Resettable`? sounds like a good exercise

refactoring
  - rename `ticks` -> `frames` everywhere
  - refactor `ray_idx` into an enum: { CollisionRay(i16), ShellRay(i16) }
  - remove `scale_translation` and `set_translation`, replace with `modify_translation`
    - also rename `modify_translation` -> `assign_translation`
  - change argments of `vec3_from!` so that it's `u op v`
  - rename `vec3_unit_xz` -> `vec3_lateral_unit`
  - fix signedness of everything; anything that can never be negative should be unsigned

perf
  - is it possible to drop the static `include_bytes!` data after
    reading it into tables? (e.g. for stage config table)

bugs
  - sometimes a bunch of attached props stop updating and freeze in place while the katamari
    continues moving away from them
    - it's possible that this is just those props getting disabled, but this code doesn't set their
      alpha to 0 to they remain visible.
      - it's not *entirely* that though, since it can happen with very few props attached
      - but this is definitely happening when props are destroyed near the end
        of `Katamari::update_collision`
  - when entering a pinch input from consistent non-pinch push inputs, the katamari
    will orbit around in a circle for some reason
    - e.g. pinch, pump right stick up, then go back to pinch
  - playing the original sim, then playing open sim, results in earthquake glitch in open sim
  - when holding forward into a wall, you keep bouncing off of it without ever trying to climb it.
    this is definitely not what happens in the real sim - it's much easier to climb without bonking
  - can't go inside of bowls like in original sim - is there a concave collision flag?
    - possibly related - mas1 tv stand also has aabb collision even when katamari is small, you
      can't go under it
  - you get stuck moving over the new year's card on the mas1 table sometimes

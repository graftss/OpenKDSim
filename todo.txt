random things that shouldn't be forgotten:

- is it possible to drop the static `include_bytes!` data after
  reading it into tables? (e.g. for stage config table)

- gachas are bugged somehow: holding one stick up and repeating up-down on the other stick
  will yield gachas
  - (probably just not correctly checking what the previous gacha dir was)

- when entering a pinch input from consistent non-pinch push inputs, the katamari
  will orbit around in a circle for some reason

- `Reset` interface to reset attempt-specific bits of game state
  - implement it on all parts of `GameState`
  - `derive` it on structs for which all fields are `Resettable`? sounds like a good exercise

- `Serialize` interface for save/loading savestates

- rename `ticks` -> `frames` everywhere
- refactor `ray_idx` into an enum: { CollisionRay(i16), ShellRay(i16) }
- `physics_flags.groudned_ray_type` shouldn't be an option, the defult should just be Bottom
- remove `scale_translation` and `set_translation`, replace with `modify_translation`
  - also rename `modify_translation` -> `assign_translation`
- change argments of `vec3_from!` so that it's `u op v`
- rename `vec3_unit_xz` -> `vec3_lateral_unit`
- fix signedness of everything; anything that can never be negative should be unsigned
- `ending`, `tutorial`, and `vsmode` fields of `MissionState` shouldn't be options.

bugs
  - `SoundId::HitGround` not playing in `update_vault_and_climb`
  - sometimes a bunch of attached props stop updating and freeze in place while the katamari
    continues moving away from them
    - it's possible that this is just those props getting disabled, but this code doesn't set their
      alpha to 0 to they remain visible.

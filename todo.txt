random things that shouldn't be forgotten:

- port the janky implementation of `power` (offset: 0x26910) to 
  use in `Prop::init_aabb_and_volume`
- is it possible to drop the static `include_bytes!` data after 
  reading it into tables? (e.g. for stage config table)

- gachas are bugged somehow: holding one stick up and repeating up-down on the other stick
  will yield gachas
  - (probably just not correctly checking what the previous gacha dir was)

- when entering a pinch input from consistent non-pinch push inputs, the katamari
  will orbit around in a circle for some reason

random things that shouldn't be forgotten:

- is it possible to drop the static `include_bytes!` data after 
  reading it into tables? (e.g. for stage config table)

- gachas are bugged somehow: holding one stick up and repeating up-down on the other stick
  will yield gachas
  - (probably just not correctly checking what the previous gacha dir was)

- when entering a pinch input from consistent non-pinch push inputs, the katamari
  will orbit around in a circle for some reason

- `Resettable` interface to reset attempt-specific bits of game state
  - implement it on all parts of `GameState`
  - `derive` it on structs for which all fields are `Resettable`? sounds like a good exercise

- rename `ticks` -> `frames` everywhere
- refactor `ray_idx` into an enum: { CollisionRay(i16), ShellRay(i16) }
- `physics_flags.groudned_ray_type` shouldn't be an option, the defult should just be Bottom
- remove `scale_translation` and `set_translation`, replace with `modify_translation`
  - also rename `modify_translation` -> `assign_translation`
- change argments of `vec3_from!` so that it's `u op v`

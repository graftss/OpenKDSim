unimplemented
  - prop motion
  - turntables: `kat_apply_turntable_contact`
  - water: `kat_update_water_contact`
  - dynamic prop alphas
  - props with subobjects - where does rotation come from?
  - a billion other things


features
  savestates
    - `Serialize` interface for save/loading savestates, implemented on all
      relevant game state structs
  resetting
    - `Reset` interface to reset attempt-specific bits of game state
      - implement it on all parts of `GameState`
      - `derive` it on structs for which all fields are `Resettable`? sounds like a good exercise

refactoring
  - rename `ticks` -> `frames` everywhere
  - refactor `ray_idx` into an enum: { CollisionRay(i16), ShellRay(i16) }
  - remove `scale_translation` and `set_translation`, replace with `modify_translation`
    - also rename `modify_translation` -> `assign_translation`
  - change argments of `vec3_from!` so that it's `u op v`
  - rename `vec3_unit_xz` -> `vec3_lateral_unit`
  - fix signedness of everything; anything that can never be negative should be unsigned
  - change stage config sound id methods to return Option<SoundId>
    - change `play_sound_fx` to accept `Option<SoundId>` instead of `SoundId`

perf
  - is it possible to drop the static `include_bytes!` data after
    reading it into tables? (e.g. for stage config table)

bugs
  - sometimes a bunch of attached props stop updating and freeze in place while the katamari
    continues moving away from them
    - it's possible that this is just those props getting disabled, but this code doesn't set their
      alpha to 0 to they remain visible.
      - it's not *entirely* that though, since it can happen with very few props attached
      - but this is definitely happening when props are destroyed near the end
        of `Katamari::update_collision`
  - original simulation can climb into the pink bowl at mas1 spawn at init size, open sim you can't
  - still clip through table
    - 10.3cm mas1, trying to climb up mas1 red phones by the sword is wrong in open sim
      - you clip through the phones unless you move really slowly
  - boosting doesn't feel right at all
  - downhill acceleration is wrong: nb wild speeds just off the white part of the mas1 tablecloth
    where the cord goes under it
